            <h3 class="article-tittle">Why Everyone Should Travel</h3>
            <p>
                Put simply, travelling is one of life´s greatest experiences. There is no price you can put on
                the experience you get from travelling.
                The people you meet, the sites you see, the moments you create, and the knowledge you gain
                about yourself and other cultures are all part of the experience that makes life richer.
            </p>
            <h4>Always Say Yes</h4>
            <p>
                Never turn down an opportunity to travel. Whether you have a long-held dream of visiting somewhere
                specific, or a friend invites you to join him or her on an escape, or your partner suggests
                taking a vacation together, do it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Travel nourishes the mind, the body, and the soul in ways few other things can. Additionally,
                travel provides moments that lead to irreplaceable and priceless memories.
            </p>
            <h4>Why Travel?</h4>
            <p>
                Travelling broadens our horizons, and helps us grow. When travelling for a period longer than
                a couple of months, it´s common to hear people say they return feeling as if they were a changed person.
            </p>
            <p>
                Destination, however, doesn´t play as big of a role in how memorable or enjoyable a vacation is
                as we think.
            </p>
            <p>
                To quote sociologist Charles Horton Cooley, “To get away from one’s working environment is, in a sense,
                to get away from one’s self; and this is often the chief advantage of travel and change.”
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the reasons we love to travel so much is because it allows us to we break our routines and
                experience new things.
            </p>
            <p>
                Travel writer Bill Bryson says, “To my mind, the greatest reward and luxury of travel is to be able
                to experience everyday things as if for the first time, to be in a position in which almost nothing
                is so familiar it is taken for granted.”
            </p>
            <p>
                While, author Chelsea Cain says, "For some reason when I travel, I am able to surrender more than
                in my real life. I am able to let go. I think it's why I like it so much."
